# Abstract

The goal of this project was to perform regression model to predict the price of diamonds. We worked with dataset which has a lot of features
to do analysis and prediction of the Diamonds.

# Design

This project dataset was provided by Kaggle, We use this data to bulid a model to predict the Diamonds price.

# Data

The Diamonds dataset contains a few feature include Carat, Price, Cut, Color, Clarity, depth and Table. 

Raws:53,940 rows
Columns: 10 columns, which are Carat, Price, Cut, Color, Clarity, depth, Tabel and (x represent length, y represent width and z represent depth)


# Algorithms

Linear regression 
Ridge
polynomial 
Random forest

# Tools

Http 
Beautiful soup for web scraping 
Python Jupyter Notebook
Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting
sklearn for machine learning

# Communication

After testing our model this figuer shows how we got a perfct predict on our model.
